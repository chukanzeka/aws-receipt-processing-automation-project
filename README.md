🧠 Project Overview  
Manual receipt management can be frustrating — lost or faded paper copies, scattered digital receipts, and endless hours of manual data entry.  

To solve this, I built a serverless, automated receipt processing system using AWS services. The solution extracts data from receipts, stores it securely for querying and auditing, and notifies users in real time — removing the hassle of manual input.

🚀 AWS Services Used

- **Amazon Textract** → Extracts key data from PDFs and images (vendor, date, items, total).  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** → Stores structured data for fast querying and audits.  
- **Amazon SES** → Sends instant email notifications with extracted receipt details.  
- **Amazon SNS** → Triggers automated error alerts if processing fails.  
- **AWS Lambda + S3** → Handle real-time file processing when new receipts are uploaded.  
- **IAM Roles & Policies** → Ensure secure access between AWS services.

🏗️ System Workflow  

1. User uploads a receipt image or PDF to an S3 bucket**.  
2. Lambda** triggers **Amazon Textract** to extract relevant fields.  
3. Extracted data is stored in **DynamoDB** for structured querying.  
4. **Amazon SES** sends an email notification with the extracted receipt details.  
5. If Textract fails, **Amazon SNS** sends a real-time error alert via email.

🛑 Challenge Encountered    

Initially, when **Amazon Textract** failed to process a receipt, I had to manually search **CloudWatch Logs** to find the error which was time-consuming and inefficient.  

To fix this, I integrated **Amazon SNS** for **automatic error alerts**. Now, whenever Textract fails, users receive an **immediate email** with detailed failure information.  
This drastically improved usability and system transparency.

💡 Key Learnings   

- **Amazon Textract** works best with structured receipts (e.g., restaurant or retail bills).  
- It supports **PDF**, **JPEG**, and **PNG** formats.  
- Textract can misread skewed or unclear text (e.g., “rn” → “m”).
